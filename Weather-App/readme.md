## Introduction

OpenWeatherMap provide highly recognisable weather products that make working with the weather data a way easier.
their weather products are accessible via fast, reliable APIs that follow industry standards and compatible with different kind of enterprise systems.
We will be using this API for our script


## In this project

The goal of this project was to create a program in Python that displays weather information (e.g., the current weather and the weather forecast)
based on a user's input (location of interest).


## Pre-requisites

1. Python version 3.6+ (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
The program was developed for and tested with Python 3.9. but may work with previous Python versions, but this was not tested.

2. The following packages are required for the program to work:
- requests (https://requests.readthedocs.io/)
- OS (built-in in Python 3)
- json (built-in in Python 3)
- pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/)

3. OpenWeather API key:
OpenWeather (https://openweathermap.org/api)


## Instructions

1. Add your own OpenWeather API key in the "API_KEY.py" file
2. Open "Weather.py"
3. Run the program. (Tip: You can use an IDE such as PyCharm to run this program.)


## Program Description & Features

1. Get the current weather information for any city in the world.
2. Get the weather forecast for 5 days / 3 hours intervals for any city in the world.
